# AI Sudoku Solver

Everyone must be aware of the Sudoku game (a logic-based combinatorial number-placement puzzle).
With the help of computervision  using python3  i made a realtime solver which takes the grid from an image shown through the webcam of the PC/laptop and with the help classification model using neuralnetworks trained on my dataset with resnet50 using Fastai extracted the content from the image and solved the game with Backtracking Algorithm.
The final output is the solved sudoku with all the previously empty spaces filled with the desired number for a successful Sudoku game.
